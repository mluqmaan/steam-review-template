# Steam Review Template Generator

Welcome, brave reviewer, to the **Steam Review Template Generator**! Ever wanted to channel your inner game critic and leave a review that’s both insightful and vaguely meme-ish? Well, now you can. This project is here to help you rate games like a pro, complete with witty categories, unnecessary checkboxes, and the occasional existential question. Strap in, this is going to be a bumpy ride.

## What is This?
Imagine having the power to review a game with the same format that thousands of others use but with your own twist. We give you that **review template magic**, where you can rate graphics, gameplay, and even bugs (because let’s be honest, they’re inevitable) all in one neat, copy-pastable summary.

## Features
- **Checkbox Madness**: Check ‘em all or just a few. Each category has multiple choices, but there can only be one true answer (unless you're feeling indecisive).
- **Witty Ratings**: Rate aspects like **Graphics** ("You forget what reality is"), **Gameplay** ("Watch paint dry instead"), and the all-important **Bugs** ("The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs").
- **Copy-Paste Review Generator**: Generate your review text and instantly annoy your friends by sending it to them over Discord.

## How It Works
1. Open up the live page (once it's, you know... actually live).
2. Fill out each category based on your thoughts about the game. **Graphics?** Good. **Gameplay?** Meh. **PC Requirements?** Ask NASA if they have a spare computer.
3. Click the big shiny button, and voila! Your personalized Steam-like review is ready for sharing!

## Example Review
Here's a taste of what you can create:
```
---{ Graphics }---
☑ You forget what reality is

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good

---{ Audience }---
☑ Teens
☑ Adults

---{ Bugs }---
☑ ARK: Survival Evolved
```
You too can create masterpieces like this. **Dream big, reviewer.**

## Contributions
Do you have some extra funny categories that could be added? Did we forget to rate "Number of DLCs you need to sell a kidney for"? Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Together, we can make this review template **even more ridiculous**.

## Known Issues
- The site might still be building. Chill, grab a coffee, maybe rate a game in your head while you wait.
- No, this doesn’t actually post reviews to Steam. You’ll still have to **copy-paste** like it’s 1987.

## Special Thanks
To all the gamers who have endured endless bugs, impossible gameplay, and the warm embrace of a potato-quality PC. This one’s for you.

## License
Licensed under the "Rate responsibly" license. (Just kidding, it’s MIT. Go nuts.)

Remember, a great review isn’t about being right, it’s about having fun and letting everyone know **just how bad the bugs were**. Have fun and happy reviewing!
